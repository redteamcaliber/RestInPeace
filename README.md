RestInPeace
===========

Simple REST client that supports session cookies and BASIC authentication

Invoke using - python client1.py OR python client2.py. Enter a method number when prompted. Refer to the methods files in the same directory to
get the numbers. Alternatively comment/uncomment the line inside the code which prints the exact numbers.

Make sure all your methods and parameters are configured inside the methods files - else this is useless.

I wrote this during a project and there'll probably be flaws in it. If you find a problem, let me know - I'll try and fix it - or submit a patch:)
